# Wedding RSVP System

A beautiful and functional wedding RSVP system built with Next.js, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. Guests can easily RSVP through a form, and administrators can view and manage responses through a secure dashboard.

## Features

- **Guest RSVP Form**: Clean, responsive form for guests to submit their RSVP
- **Server Actions**: Secure form submission using Next.js server actions
- **Admin Dashboard**: View all guest responses with filtering and search
- **Real-time Data**: Connected to Supabase for reliable data storage
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Authentication**: Simple admin authentication system

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Supabase** for database and backend
- **Server Actions** for form handling

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

1. Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to your project dashboard
3. Create a new table called `weeding-guests` with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "weeding-guests" (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  firstname TEXT NOT NULL,
  lastname TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_coming BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

4. Get your project URL and anon key from Settings > API

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials.

### 4. Configure Database Permissions

In your Supabase dashboard, you need to allow public access to insert into the guests table:

1. Go to **Authentication** > **Policies** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **"New Policy"** on the `weeding-guests` table
3. Choose **"For full customization"**
4. Create an **INSERT** policy with this SQL:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert on weeding-guests" ON "public"."weeding-guests"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR INSERT
TO public
WITH CHECK (true);
```

5. Create a **SELECT** policy for admin access:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow public select on weeding-guests" ON "public"."weeding-guests"
AS PERMISSIVE FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (true);
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the RSVP form.

```

## Customization

### Changing the Admin Password

Edit the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` constant in `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx`

### Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS. You can customize colors, fonts, and layout by modifying the className attributes in the components.

### Form Fields

To add more fields to the RSVP form:

1. Update the database schema in Supabase
2. Modify the `Guest` type in `src/types/database.ts`
3. Update the form component and server actions

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Add your environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

### Other Platforms

Make sure to set your environment variables in your deployment platform and ensure your Supabase project allows connections from your domain.

## Security Notes

- The current admin authentication is basic and suitable for personal use
- For production use, consider implementing proper authentication with Supabase Auth
- The service role key should never be exposed to the client side
- Consider adding rate limiting for the RSVP form

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check that your Supabase credentials are correct
2. Ensure your database table schema matches the expected structure
3. Verify that your environment variables are properly set
4. Check the browser console and server logs for error messages

Happy wedding planning! ðŸ’’
